        <p class="paragraph">    The story of AAA begins in 1982 when its founder and self-described "Master of the Seas" Mackenzie Burgess inherited an industrial grade
          fruit pulper and thirty four tons of rock salt from her strangest uncle. The following decades brought great fame and enormous success, but with material
          wealth came eccentricity, decadence, and paranoia. In 2021, following a well-publicized and widely misunderstood relationship with the fruit pulper, MOTS
          was forced to sell her forest green megayacht, "The Floating Ahuacatl" and resign in disgrace. News of MOTS' departure triggered widespread panic; frenzied
          citizens looted farmer's markets and Breville outlets across the country in an orgy of undercaffeinated violence.  Order was restored only after it was
          announced that Abe, a longtime MOTS confidant and former carnival strongman had stepped in to continue The Work. With Abe's preternaturally handsome
          leadership to guide us, the future is surely bright.
          <br><br>
          All hail Abe! All hail The Work!
